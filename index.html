<p> How are you going to be skux, if you have no way for people to see that your skux. To solve this problem, you will have to procure a mode of transportation, or a skux vehicle. When choosing a skux vehicle, make sure its not new, 2013 is the latest vehicle you can buy and still be skux.
  Japanese cars, or dirtbikes, are the only skux modes of transportation besides riding a bike. You may wonder why skateboarding isnt skux, its because if you use a skateboard then your a skateboarder, not a skux person. They are very different subsections of person, and are often consufed.
  Back to vehicles, usually all nissan, subaru, toyota, honda, and mazda cars made before 2013, weather its a hatchback or a ute or even a dirtbike it is usually skux. Some examples of skux cars is the Mazda MX-5, Subaru WRX, Honda Civic, Toyota Altezza, Nissan 350z, and most cars availble on trademe or facebook markeplace for under 10k. 
  If its a deal of a cheap car, that can do mean asssssssss skids, its garunteed to be skux.
